# Bobby Gatlin

# write a program that:
# 1. greets the user in English
# 2. asks the user to choose from 1 of 3 spoken languages (pick your favorite languages!) 
# 3. displays the greeting in the chosen language
# 4. exits

# make sure that your code contains comments explaining your logic!


#First I just want to setup everything with print
print ('Hello World!')
print ('')
print ('Pick a language and I will greet you in that language')
print ('1.Dutch')
print ('2.Portuguese')
print ('3.Italian') #The next thing I did was define a value to the variable c
print('')
c=int(input())
if c==1:
    print ('Hello wereld')
if c==2:
    print ("Ol√° mundo")
if c==3:
    print ("Ciao mondo")

#That's it.
#The code successfully greets with Hello World in Dutch, Portuguese, or Italian and then exits.
